Each button can jump to a different view on the page. Everything is listed already, but the buttons are for those who have a larger screen view and donâ€™t want to scroll forever just to select items at the bottom. 

The shopping cart can also account for items added and allows for increments and decrements in item choices. It also shows a total price for the items selected. Here is an example.
